Although seedlings rarely establish naturally in most wetland situations, seedlingscan be produced easily indoors. Seed collection should be delayed until the majority of the fruit in the cluster has turned brown, because immature fruit will fall from the cluster along with ripe ones when the cluster is shaken toremove the fruit. It is not necessary to remove the fruit coverings before sowing, but this is easily done by rubbing. The seed can be stored dry, but should be placed in a moist medium and stored in the refrigerator for three months before sowing. The growing medium must bekept moist, but not saturated and air temperatures should be at least 75 °F. The seedlings can be planted in the wetland when they are approximately one foot tall.',
